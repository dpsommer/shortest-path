# Faster Shortest Paths  

Python implementation of the single-source shortest-path algorithm defined in *[Breaking the Sorting Barrier for Directed Single-Source Shortest Paths](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17033)* (Duan et al, 2025). Requires a `networkx` graph input.  

The algorithm is theoretically faster than an optimized Dijkstra's, generalized to directed and undirected graphs.
